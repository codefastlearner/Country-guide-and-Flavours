The header contains a nav-bar with links to different sections including our social media pages (this is still a work in progress, link will be active in next update).

The user can also share the result on social media as well as save it on their device (this feature will be available in next update).

Also, there is some list of available countries on the landing page with brief descriptions for quicker exploration. This includes exploring the country's list of amazing dishes which can be accessed by clicking the "explore flavour" button just below the descriptions.
